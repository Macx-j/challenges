// The code initializes a variable `bill` with the value 275, representing the total bill amount.

// The code then uses a conditional (ternary) operator to calculate the tip percentage based on the value of `bill`. If `bill` is between 50 and 300 (inclusive), the tip percentage is set to 0.15 (15%). Otherwise, if `bill` is outside that range, the tip percentage is set to 0.2 (20%). The calculated tip percentage is stored in the variable `tipPercentage`.

// The code calculates the tip amount by multiplying the `bill` with the `tipPercentage`. The result is stored in the variable `tip`.

// The code calculates the total value by adding the `bill` and the `tip`. The result is stored in the variable `totalValue`.

// Finally, the code uses `console.log()` to print a message that includes the original bill amount, the calculated tip amount, and the total value. The message is constructed using template literals, which allow variables to be inserted into a string using `${}`.

//In summary, this code calculates the tip amount and total value for a given bill amount. It uses a conditional operator to determine the appropriate tip percentage based on the bill amount, and then calculates the tip and total value accordingly. The final message is printed to the console, providing a summary of the bill, tip, and total value.
